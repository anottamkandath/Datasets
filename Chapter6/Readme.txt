This folder contains the experimental results from Chapter 6 of the thesis where we present three different algorithms to compute the quality of annotations.

steve_data_eswc.py builds the test set(test.rdf) and training set(train.df) from the Steve.Museum dataset.


predictions_multivalued_alternative.py is the procedure to compute the quality of annotations with sorting the annotations in test set per annotator.

data_1.rdf and data_2.rdf are the data from SEALINCMedia expirement.
