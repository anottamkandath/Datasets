This folder contains the experimental results which prove that discounting operator in Subjective Logic
is similar to the weighing operator.

In the file Asian_Chinese, the first column is the user_id. The second and third column indicates the
number of positive and negative evaluations of tag "Chinese" by the same user for different artefacts. Rows 1 to 9 show the results of computing the reputation of the users using Subjective Logic Discounting operator and 
rows 12 to 20 show the results of applying Subjective Logic weighing operator. Rows 23 to 31 shows the positive and negative evidence for the tag "Asian" entered by the same users and the values of belief, dis-belief and uncertainty.
The weighing and discounting operations are done by using the semantic similarity measure 

After applying statistical significance tests on the E value, we conclude that the results from the two operators are not statistically different.
