This folder contains the experimental results from Chapter 3 of the thesis where we use subjective logic and semantic similarity measures for determining the quality of annotations provided to Steve.Museum dataset.

The excel weighted_non-weighted contains the evaluation of the annotation using both semantic similarity and without semantic similarity techniques.

The other sheets contain the list of annotations provided by users with different user idâ€™s and their predicted evaluations.
